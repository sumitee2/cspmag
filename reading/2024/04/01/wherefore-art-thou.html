<p class="postContent"> <p>Why?</p>

<p>The easier way to answer a question is by beginning to unravel the question itself – pull the earth beaneath its feet and it may yield to its own demands. It is also a time-tested way to clarify the mind itself in the centifuge of circumlocution. One way to begin is by answering Eliot’s complaint, that most literary reviews fall into one or some of the errors that he enumerates. For example, a review may be too wide or too narrow in its material and scope, it may be too autocratic or too anarchic, editorially speaking, and so on. Chief among these flaws is catering to one man’s taste and that man’s alone. Another is a strict adherence to a’programme’. The way out of these extremities of virtue is by resorting to a <strong>Tendency</strong>.</p>

<p>What tendency does this review proclaim? A difficult question, more so in the diversity of the current literary scene. Yet, by virtue of this difficulty or otherwise, it is also one of those questions that can be answered retrospectively and need only be answered slantly at present. To declare a tendency, it is better to define the tendency of this tendency in forming itself. So let it suffice at the moment that <strong>The Monad</strong> will first gather its components from the literary world and only then appraise the results recursively. The submission guidelines for the first issue will shed more light on the matter. Sure, a few terms like quality, integrity, inventiveness, classicity etc can be thrown in but this really does not add much.</p>

<p>There are a few questions that loom over any effort of this sort. Inclusivity, for example. Any collection can either challenge the existing canon or feed it.</p>
