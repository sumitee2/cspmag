		      <h2><a href="/general/2024/04/01/wherefore-art-thou.html">Why another literary review?</a></h2>
		      <p>The easier way to answer a question is by beginning to unravel the question itself – pull the earth beaneath its feet and it may yield to its own demands. It is also a time-tested way to clarify the mind itself in the centifuge of circumlocution. One way to begin is by answering Eliot’s complaint, that most literary reviews fall into one or some of the errors that he enumerates. For example, a review may be too wide or too narrow in its material and scope, it may be too autocratic or too anarchic, editorially speaking, and so on. Chief among these flaws is catering to one man’s taste and that man’s alone. Another is a strict adherence to a’programme’. The way out of these extremities of virtue is by resorting to a <strong>Tendency</strong>.</p>

		      <h2><a href="/reading/2021/04/14/the-stone-angel.html">The Stone Angel</a></h2>
		      <p>The Stone Angel by Margaret Lawrence is a rare book both in its choice of protagonist and language. It is unifromly poetic with a rustic prairie charm peppered in. The range and depth of emotion can hardly be found in another novel. One can say, even Joyce and Woolf pale in front of this insightful treatment of old age and womanhood. So far, I have not been able to pick up reading pace because reading this book is like a slow walk through strange
Canadian woods and one has to stop and admire the tendrillous manifestations of lingusitic shoots.</p>
